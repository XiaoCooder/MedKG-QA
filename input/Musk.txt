说话人1 00:00
My first guess is the man who made electric cars a thing, and is currently working on perfecting reusable rockets, space travel, connecting the human brain, directly to computers, connecting cities with electromagnetic bullet trains. The starling satellite system that's so important to the war in ukraine. And then on tuesday,
说话人2 00:18
it's gonna work on that tunnel thing on traffic. He also tweet a.
说话人1 00:22
lot elon musk right here. Nasa. What did I get the full order of things that you do in a day there? When I was reading there? I left out the tunnel thing at the end. Do you work on all these a lot of jobs? Do you do all these things every day? Do you work on all of them in a single day?
说话人3 00:52
No,
说话人1 00:53
no, but I.
说话人3 00:55
I do have a long workday. So I work a lot.
说话人1 01:02
I'm so thrilled you're here because we do a show where we talk about what changes happen in the world, but we just talk. There's a very few people who actually make change happen. You are one of those people probably.
说话人2 01:16
Yeah, I.
说话人3 01:23
I supposed to say I love this audience.
说话人1 01:29
You're a likable guy. I like I they attack you a lot better. Yeah. And you seem to laugh it off, which I think is fantastic. I love it that you have a sense of humor because a guy as important as you who makes changes could use your powers for evil and not good.

The fact that.
说话人2 01:50
absolutely you could, I.
说话人3 01:53
I I never use them for evil. No, I know.
说话人1 01:58
But the way I know.
说话人2 01:59
that is because you have.
说话人1 02:00
a sense of humor,
说话人3 02:01
yeah.
说话人1 02:02
You really do you like laughing? You like to.
说话人3 02:06
be funny? I kill.
说话人1 02:07
me, right?
说话人2 02:08
No, I.
说话人1 02:13
as opposed to somebody like zuckerberg who i'm not even sure is a real boy.
说话人3 02:23
Iii actually love comedy and actually like many years ago, I actually was in the audience here and watch your show really been a long time admirer of your show.
说话人1 02:32
Thank you.
说话人2 02:35
Byebye. I.
说话人1 02:39
let me get back to you being a genius. I'm sorry. But that has always been my view, is that as I was a history major and when you study history, what you realize is that there's the great man theory and they talk about kings and princes and queens and presidents. It's really the people in tech who changed the world. They're the people who deal the cards, whether it's fire or electricity for good or bad, or the cotton gin, or the iphone or the atom bomb, those are the cards and the rest of us just play it. Would you agree with that assessment?
说话人3 03:15
I I think technology is the thing that causes these big step changes in civilization.

So obviously, you've got things like, say, the gutenberg press before which.
说话人1 03:26
it.
说话人3 03:26
was very difficult to get books. They were pretty rare. Even if you had a thirst for knowledge, you really couldn't do anything about it. Because there were very few books to read. And the internet is something beyond the good, but price I think, but it's a i'm gonna, first of all, the internet coming into being in a way that the general public could use it. It felt like what the humanity as a whole was developing a nervous system. So previously, the way that information would travel would be by osmosis, one person to another or one person calling another. You did the access to information is very limited.

Now with the internet, it's like having a nervous systems like any part of humanity has access to almost all the information of humanity.

Like you could be in the middle of the amazon jungle, whether it's a starling terminal and have access to more information than the president did in 1980.
说话人1 04:27
Right? Anything on your phone,
说话人3 04:28
every everything.
说话人1 04:30
is.

So you are one of these dealers, these people who deal the cards. And so.
说话人3 04:36
I deal some names, too.
说话人2 04:38
So quickly.
说话人1 04:50
So I think a lot of people thought when you bought twitter that this is kind of an outlier, like, how does this what doesn't fit with these other things you're doing? I never thought that. Because I think what you're dealing with big civilization issues and problems. And I was right on your page. I think twitter is one of them. I you have talked about this woke mine virus. Yes. In really apocalyptic terms, I you shouldn't explain why you don't think it's hyperbole to say things like it's pushing civilization towards suicide.

First of all, what is the woke mind virus? And if we don't deal with this, nothing else can get done. Tell me why you think that.
说话人3 05:28
Yeah. I think we need to be very cautious about any anything that is anti meritocratic, and anything that is that results in the suppression of free speech.

So those are two of the aspects of the work mind virus that I think are very dangerous, is that it's often anti meritocratic and you can't question things. Even the questioning is bad.

So if you another way to you're all almost anonymous, would we cancel culture? And obviously people have tried to cancel you.
说话人1 06:04
many.
说话人3 06:04
times. I.
说话人1 06:05
every week, yeah.
说话人2 06:07
From left and.
说话人1 06:09
right. I've had it from both sides. Yeah, and it's interesting people you and I are both like in that little group of people. Maybe it's a bigger group. Yeah. Who are called conservative, who haven't really changed. I don't see you think of you as a conservative. I definitely.
说话人3 06:23
Yeah, like iii at least think of myself as a moderate. So I at least the like i've spent aa massive amount of my life energy building sustainable energy, electric vehicles and batteries and solar and stuff to help save the environment. That's not a.
说话人2 06:43
no. Is it?
说话人3 06:48
Not exactly far right?

Now.
说话人1 06:49
you drew that diagram.
说话人2 06:51
You drew that diagram.
说话人1 06:53
once where you're here. Ii related to that, and like the world has changed, right? I feel the same way. I feel like very often weakness is not building on liberalism. It's the opposite of liberalism. I can mention.
说话人3 07:04
exactly many.
说话人1 07:05
examples where it's the op, including free speech.
说话人3 07:07
Free speech is actually is extremely important. And it's bizarre that we've come to this point where like free speech used to be aaa left or liberal value.

Yet we see from in courts left aaa desire to actually censor. That seems crazy. I ii think we should be extremely concerned about anything that undermines the first amendment. There's a reason for the first amendment.

The first moment is because people came from countries where they could not speak freely and where saying certain things would get you thrown into prison. And they were like, we don't want that here. And by the way, in many parts of the world, including possible that people might think are relatively similar to the united states. The speech laws are draconian.
说话人1 08:01
England is quite different. I.
说话人3 08:02
won't name any countries. But.
说话人2 08:06
england,
说话人1 08:07
why are we protecting them? They have no first.
说话人2 08:09
amendment. It's very easy to prove.
说话人1 08:11
libel in england, whereas here it's.
说话人3 08:13
almost england,
说话人2 08:15
but ii.
说话人1 08:16
wouldn't want to say the wrong thing.
说话人3 08:18
Or.
说话人1 08:19
you could be sued easier. There I there are a lot in france. I think if you deny the holocaust, which I think is abhorrent, but I also think it should be part of free speech, right? You can be thrown into jail.
说话人3 08:32
Ii really can't emphasize this enough. We must we must protect free speech. And free speech only matters. It's only relevant when it's someone you don't like, saying something you don't like, because obviously, for speech that you like is it's easy. A and it's the thing about censorship is that sure, for those who would advocate it, just remember at some point that will be turned on you. Yeah.
说话人1 09:05
Woke mind virus. How did it start? Was it bats? Was it escape from a lab?
说话人2 09:12
I.
说话人1 09:13
what is your assessment of what cause it's fairly recent? How did it start? And why?
说话人3 09:20
I I so I was trying to figure out where it's coming from. I think it's actually been a long time brewing in that. It's ii think it's been going on for a while. It and the amount of indoctrination that's happening in schools and universities is I think far beyond what parents realize.

Ii I sort of came to realize this some somewhat late the experience that we had in high school and college is not the experience that kids today are having and hasn't been for, I don't know ten ten years, maybe 20 years.

So.
说话人1 10:02
parents themselves also a big part of the problem. Think.
说话人3 10:06
ii suppose in some cases, the parents, but I think like the parents are just generally not aware of what their kids are being taught or what they're not being taught.
说话人1 10:16
They're letting the kids think that they're equal.
说话人3 10:20
I let me give you an example that a friend of mine told me which his daughters go to college and sorry, go to high school in the bay area. And he was asking them like, so who are the who are the first few presidents of the united states? They could name washington, but and I said, what do you know about him? He was a slave owner. What else? Right? Exactly. Nothing. Right? Like that's maybe you should know more than that.
说话人1 10:50
Yeah, and.
说话人2 10:52
that is the world mind virus. Exactly. Yeah, no.
说话人3 10:57
Exactly. It's like the slavery is obviously aa horrific institution, but we should still know more about george washington.
说话人1 11:08
By the way, one that was practiced all over the world forever since the beginning of time by every race, including people of color. I'm sorry to tell you that it's huge in the bible.
说话人3 11:18
Absolutely. So.
说话人1 11:18
bible loves it.
说话人3 11:19
Iii.
说话人2 11:21
really.
说话人3 11:22
they're quite strict about like don't take someone else's slave in that.
说话人1 11:26
kind of right, but no one ever says just don't do it.
说话人3 11:29
They don't at no point. Does it say slavery is.
说话人1 11:32
not? No,
说话人2 11:32
I won't no, they did.
说话人3 11:34
not condemn it at all, but they just.

So.
说话人1 11:38
but twitter is not doing bad, right? I I saw it today that tucker carlson recently fired. You were just on his show and he lost his job. So I hope this isn't a win.
说话人2 11:48
Yeah. But hopefully, what are you the angel of death? You gotta know exactly. I'm.
说话人3 11:53
not the typhoid mary of talk shows.
说话人2 11:57
But.
说话人3 11:58
for some reason, people just get fired out his.
说话人1 12:00
rant yesterday or today on twitter.
说话人3 12:04
I guess yesterday or something that or did.
说话人1 12:05
more than every cable news monologue, something like that. Is that right?
说话人3 12:11
Twitter has a tremendous audience, so there's 250 million people that spend an average of half an hour a day on twitter. So it's about 120 to 130 million user hours per day, and it's been increasing. So we didn't do anything to be clear. We did nothing special whatsoever. Ii learned about it afterwards that he had posted something on twitter. So it's just that twitter has a lot of people's attention. It tends to be the people that are that read a lot or are interested in card events generally are pretty influential.

So.
说话人1 12:47
but most of the people who tweet are the same people, right? I the people who actually tweet it's supposed to just reading it. Yeah. I feel like that's i've read this many times. That's a very very small percentage of the people on twitter and it seems like, yeah. See, here's why I don't tweet anymore because you may be the mayor of tweet town now and the mayor of tweet town.
说话人2 13:05
And we only have capsule.
说话人1 13:07
and i'm glad.
说话人2 13:08
and I like it that.
说话人1 13:09
the mayor likes my jokes.

But the reason I don't do it anymore is because the mob girls is still there.
说话人2 13:16
And that has not changed. I know it's too easy to get cancelled. And.
说话人1 13:23
I don't even know what pisses them off. They're so nuts. These kids. I feel like i'm walking on a roof with a blindfold. I could fall off any time.
说话人2 13:31
That.
说话人1 13:32
was the most innocuous thing. But it's like, I said, george washington was a great president. How dare you?
说话人3 13:38
Yeah. Exactly. I had some flaws, but ii.
说话人1 13:41
how do you fix.
说话人3 13:42
that instrumental in the equation of the united states? You have to say like, what does cancelled mean? I people attack you on twitter.

That's one thing, but Frankly, that's just going to increase engagement. So I would just ignore it.
说话人1 13:57
That's easy for you because.
说话人2 13:59
they can't.
说话人1 13:59
take your job away or any of your main ten jobs, but they could take mine and they did once, by the way. Yeah.
说话人3 14:06
So.
说话人1 14:07
I was like literally canceled. I.
说话人2 14:10
the show is cancelled.
说话人1 14:13
But so you were at congress the other day talking with Chuck Schumer about AI I'm very interested in this because you've been on this for years. I've always thought you were right about this. I think you're right about almost everything. I let's have more babies and raise them on Mars. I don't get that, but okay.
说话人3 14:30
I think we should be cautious about civilization will decline with and we have plummeting growth rates. Most places, right?
说话人1 14:39
And also plummeting resources. No,
说话人3 14:42
we resources will be fine,
说话人1 14:43
but they're not fine now that if they're.
说话人3 14:46
look, I'm not suggesting complacency, we do want to move to a sustainable energy economy as quickly as possible, but we're not in any danger of resource collapse.
说话人1 14:56
Lots of people don't have enough food or water, water. We will run out of water, they're running out of sand.
说话人3 15:04
Now, this earth is 70 % water by soviet Syria, and you.
说话人1 15:08
can't drink that the.
说话人3 15:09
your desalination is absurdly cheap.
说话人1 15:12
Why don't we do it? Then?
说话人3 15:14
We do it is done.
说话人1 15:15
You have a lot of Free time.
说话人3 15:16
It is done. This. There is a lot of desalination done,
说话人1 15:19
but there's.
说话人3 15:20
plenty of water. This is not an issue I want to be clear. All right.
说话人1 15:22
But let's talk about AI because like you were on this tip 10 years ago when nobody else was that. And I always thought he's right. Why? Because i've seen too many movies, everything that happens in movies that happens in real.
说话人2 15:34
life. And.
说话人1 15:34
if you make things that are way smarter than you, why wouldn't they become your overlords?

So what did you say to Chuck Schumer? And what are we doing about this? I know you want to pause AI because it in the last 6 months with chat GPT which came from a company, you start started.
说话人2 15:52
Yes.
说话人3 15:55
But I a friend of mine has AA sort of modification of outcomes razor. What since sort of the simplest thing being the most likely like the most ironic outcome is the most likely, right?
说话人2 16:05
Right?
说话人3 16:07
With respect to AI I just think we should have some sort of regulatory oversight for anything that is a danger to the public. If it's sort of aircraft, cars, food, and drug and whatnot, we've got some regulatory oversight like a referee, essentially and making sure that companies don't cut corners.

So I think that since if one agrees that AI is a potential risk to the public, then there should be some regulatory body that oversees what companies are doing. So they don't cut corners and potentially do something very dangerous. That's and.
说话人2 16:45
if we don't do something,
说话人1 16:49
lay out a scenario for me in the next 25, 10 years, if nothing is done, because we're very good at doing nothing, especially when it comes in the way of profit. And this is a big profit engine.

Now, for companies, they're going to want to just compete with each other. I there are people like Ray Kurzweil, who doesn't think it's a problem at all.
说话人3 17:06
Actually, Rick, as well as prediction for artificial super Intelligence, is 2029. He's not far on.
说话人1 17:13
Right? But he doesn't think it's a problem, whereas people like you and Bill Gates, Stephen Hawking thought, I think it's a problem.
说话人3 17:21
Yeah, it depends if some people want to live forever or for a much longer period of time. And they see AI as the only way or digital super Intelligence as the only thing that can figure out how to get them to live forever. I think Kurzweil is in that category. He would prefer to have AI, artificial general Intelligence than not, because he can figure out longevity.
说话人1 17:43
So are you optimistic? Ii read in your Rolling Stone article back in the day that you said you can never be happy unless you're in love.
说话人3 17:52
You can be half happy, I suppose.
说话人2 17:54
I.
说话人3 17:56
need this. I there's two things. I think. If be full to be most happy, if you're happy in love and you love your work, then you will be, I think, fully happy if you lack either of those two. If you have one of those two things would be half happy, roughly. But.
说话人1 18:12
I feel like the theme in a lot of your works are connect. All these different things is connecting. Like you want to connect things, you want to connect on the hyperloop, and you want to connect this to Mars and even 24.
说话人2 18:27
If you want, you love that.
说话人3 18:29
game,
说话人2 18:30
what.
说话人3 18:31
you can export wake up.
说话人2 18:34
Nasa.

So this is.
说话人3 18:39
a comedy,
说话人2 18:39
right? Those are so in.
说话人3 18:41
comedy in.
说话人1 18:41
America, but.

it's hard for you because I when you bought Twitter, you kind of doing what you did when you took over when you started Tesla, you lived at the factory, right? I feel like that's your pattern. You get into this thing and then you got to live at the factory to make it work. You've been back and you moved to Texas, then you went back up to San Francisco because of Twitter.
说话人3 19:08
I I was living in the library of Twitter for a while. Yes, it is. I think things are reasonably stabilized right now. It was just on the fast track to bankruptcy after that position.

So I had to take a drastic action. There wasn't any choice,
说话人1 19:23
right? I'm just saying it's hard for a woman to like when the guy lives at the factory.
说话人2 19:29
Yes.
说话人1 19:32
That could be a stumbling block.
说话人3 19:34
Yes, it. But now overall with my concern with Twitter is to that it is somewhat of the digital town square and it's important that there be both the reality and perception of trust for a wide range of viewpoints. And there was a lot of censorship going on. And we sort of uncovered a lot of that with the Twitter files, including a lot of of government driven censorship, which.

I it seems like that's got to be a constitutional violation of what was going on there.

But and I can since I'm like an avid Twitter user, I can detect that like something's not right here. So that's really why at the acquisition, it wasn't because I thought this was an easy way to make money or something like that. It was is be being mayor of Twitter town or whatever is definitely like there's a lot of arrows pointed at you like flying at you.
说话人1 20:35
But you seem to handle that. I hope you do because I geniuses are going to be a little quirky sometimes, but your heart is always in the right place. You were trying to fix this world. I could talk to you forever. We can't today. I'd love to get high with you. I know a great place to talk.
说话人2 20:55
But I can't tell you how much I appreciate you. I know you have a lot of choices in places you can go. Thank you, Elon Musk, ladies and gentlemen. All right, i'll see you soon.
