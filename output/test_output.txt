[Chris Anderson: Elon Musk, it is great to see you. How are you?  
Elon Musk: Good. How are you?  
Chris Anderson: We are here at the Texas Giga Factory the day before it opens. It has been quite chaotic outside. Thank you for making time on such a busy day. I would like you to help us envision the future, perhaps 10, 20, or even 30 years ahead, and imagine what it would take to build a future worth being excited about. You have often mentioned that during your last speech at 10:00, you said that was a major motivator. While you discuss many other reasons for your actions, fundamentally, you want to think about the future and not feel that it is bleak.  
Elon Musk: Absolutely. I think there is a lot of discussion about various problems, and many people feel sad and pessimistic about the future. This is not ideal. We should wake up in the morning and look forward to the future with excitement.  
Chris Anderson: It happens.  
Elon Musk: Life cannot simply be about solving one miserable problem after another.  
Chris Anderson: If you look ahead 30 years to 2050, scientists have labeled it as a critical deadline for climate action. A large consensus of scientists believes that if greenhouse gases are not completely eliminated or offset by 2050, we risk a climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid this catastrophe, and what would it look like?  
Elon Musk: I am not one of the doomsday predictors. I actually believe we are on a good path. However, I want to caution against complacency. As long as we maintain a high sense of urgency in transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, things will be fine. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of pushing hard and avoiding complacency. The future will be great. Do not worry excessively, as worrying ironically becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. There are three key elements to a sustainable energy future: sustainable energy generation, primarily wind and solar, along with hydro and geothermal. I support nuclear energy as well, though solar and wind will be the main energy sources. The second element is the need for batteries to store solar and wind energy, as the sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. This requires stationary battery packs. The third element is electric transport, including electric cars, planes, and boats. While electric rockets are not feasible, sustainable propellants can be used. Ultimately, a fully sustainable energy economy is achievable through these three components: solar and wind energy, stationary battery storage, and electric vehicles. The limiting factor for progress will be battery cell production, which will determine the pace of advancement. The slowest element in the lithium-ion battery supply chain, from mining and refining to creating battery cells and assembling packs, will be the primary constraint on achieving sustainability.  
Chris Anderson: We need to discuss batteries further because I want to understand the scaling issue, which is both impressive and concerning. You mentioned that the world requires 300 terawatt hours of battery production for sustainability.  
Elon Musk: That is correct.]
