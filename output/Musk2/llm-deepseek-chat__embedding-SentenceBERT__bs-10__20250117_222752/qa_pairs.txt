chunk 00 Chris Anderson:How is Elon Musk? answer:Elon Musk is good.1 Elon Musk:How is Chris Anderson? answer:Good. How are you?2 Chris Anderson:We are here at the Texas Giga Factory the day before its opening. It has been quite chaotic outside. Thank you for making time on such a busy day. I would like you to help us envision the future, perhaps 10, 20, or even 30 years ahead, and imagine what it would take to build a future worth being excited about. You have often mentioned that, during your last speech at 10:00, you said that this is a major motivator. While you discuss many other reasons for your actions, fundamentally, you want to think about the future and not feel that it is disappointing. answer:Elon Musk believes that to build a future worth being excited about, we should focus on creating a future that is not disappointing and motivates us to look forward with excitement.3 Elon Musk:Absolutely. I think there is a lot of discussion about various problems, and many people feel sad and pessimistic about the future. This is not ideal. We should wake up in the morning and look forward to the future with excitement. answer:The question is: "Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid this catastrophe, and what would it look like?"  
The answer is: Elon Musk believes we are on a good path to avoid climate catastrophe by maintaining a high sense of urgency in transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, focusing on sustainable energy generation, battery storage, and electric transport.4 Chris Anderson:It happens. answer:Elon Musk: Life cannot simply be about solving one miserable problem after another.5 Elon Musk:Life cannot simply be about solving one miserable problem after another. answer:The question is: "Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid this catastrophe, and what would it look like?"  
Answer: Elon Musk believes we are on a good path to avoid climate catastrophe by transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, emphasizing the importance of urgency and avoiding complacency.6 Chris Anderson:If you look ahead 30 years to 2050, scientists have labeled it as a critical deadline for climate action. A large consensus of scientists believes that if greenhouse gases are not completely eliminated or offset by 2050, we risk a climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid this catastrophe, and what would it look like? answer:Elon Musk believes there is a pathway to avoid the climate catastrophe by maintaining a high sense of urgency in transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, focusing on sustainable energy generation (primarily wind and solar), battery storage, and electric transport.7 Elon Musk:I am not one of the doomsday people. I actually believe we are on a good path, but I want to caution against complacency. As long as we maintain a high sense of urgency in transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, things will be fine. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of pushing hard and avoiding complacency. The future will be great, but worrying excessively can ironically become a self-fulfilling prophecy. There are three key elements to a sustainable energy future: sustainable energy generation, primarily wind and solar, along with hydro and geothermal. I support nuclear energy as well, though solar and wind will be the main sources. The second element is the need for batteries to store solar and wind energy, as these sources are intermittent. This requires stationary battery packs. The third element is electric transport, including cars, planes, and boats. While electric rockets are not feasible, sustainable propellants can be used. Ultimately, a fully sustainable energy economy is achievable through these three components: solar and wind energy, stationary battery storage, and electric vehicles. The limiting factor for progress will be battery cell production, particularly the slowest element in the lithium-ion battery supply chain, from mining and refining to creating battery cells and assembling them into packs. This will determine the pace of progress toward sustainability. answer:Elon Musk believes that as long as we maintain a high sense of urgency in transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, things will be fine, and the future will be great.8 Chris Anderson:We need to discuss batteries further because I want to understand the scaling issue, which is both impressive and concerning. You mentioned that the world requires 300 terawatt hours of battery production for sustainability. answer:The world requires 300 terawatt hours of battery production for sustainability.9 Elon Musk:That is. answer:The question is: "You mentioned that the world requires 300 terawatt hours of battery production for sustainability."  
Answer: Elon Musk: That is.
