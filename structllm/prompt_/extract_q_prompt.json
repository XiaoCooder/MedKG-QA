Initially, we attempted to do this with image recognition on individual eye images. However, looking at a single image from a video makes it difficult to understand what is happening without ambiguity. Viewing a video segment of a few seconds resolves this ambiguity. The first step is to synchronize all eight cameras so that their frames are examined and labeled simultaneously by one person, as human labeling is still necessary. This ensures consistency in labeling, avoiding discrepancies caused by different people labeling at different times. The process involves creating a surround picture. Adding the time dimension is crucial, allowing the examination and labeling of surround video, which is challenging from a software perspective. We developed our own labeling tools and created order labeling software to enhance the efficiency of human labor. Initially, labeling a 10-second video clip took several hours, which is not scalable. The solution involves primarily automatic labeling of surround video, with humans acting as editors making minor corrections. These corrections are then fed back to improve future labeling. The goal is to enable the order laborer to process vast amounts of video with high accuracy, automatically labeling elements such as cars, lane lines, and drive space."

However, with the new architecture, you are now observing significant improvements behind the scenes. While not certain, you are fairly confident that by the end of this year, in most cities and circumstances, though not all, the car will be able to drive without interventions and safer than a human.\nElon Musk:Yes, the car currently drives me around Austin most of the time without any interventions. We have over 100,000 people in our Full Self-Driving Beta program. You can watch the videos they post online."
