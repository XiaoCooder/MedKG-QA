Chris Anderson:Elon Musk, it's great to see you. How are you?
Elon Musk:Good. How are you?
Chris Anderson:We are here at the Texas Giga Factory the day before its opening. It has been quite chaotic outside. Thank you for making time on such a busy day. I would like you to help us envision the future, perhaps 10, 20, or even 30 years ahead, and imagine what it would take to build a future worth being excited about. You have often mentioned that during your last speech at 10:00, you emphasized that this is a major motivator. While you discuss various reasons for your actions, fundamentally, you want to think about the future and ensure it is not disappointing.
Elon Musk:Absolutely. I think there is a lot of discussion about various problems, and many people feel sad and pessimistic about the future. This is not ideal. We should wake up in the morning and look forward to the future with excitement.
Chris Anderson:It happens.
Elon Musk:Life cannot simply be about solving one miserable problem after another.
Chris Anderson:If you look ahead 30 years to 2050, scientists have labeled it as a critical deadline for climate action. A large consensus of scientists believes that if greenhouse gases are not completely eliminated or offset by 2050, we risk a climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid this catastrophe, and what would it look like?
Elon Musk:I am not one of the doomsday people. I actually think we are on a good path, but I want to caution against complacency. As long as we maintain a high sense of urgency about transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, things will be fine. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of pushing hard and avoiding complacency. The future will be great, but worrying excessively can ironically become a self-fulfilling prophecy. There are three key elements to a sustainable energy future: sustainable energy generation, primarily through wind and solar, with contributions from hydro, geothermal, and nuclear energy; stationary battery storage to store solar and wind energy, as these sources are intermittent; and electric transportation, including cars, planes, and boats. While rockets cannot be fully electric, their propellants can be made sustainable. Ultimately, a fully sustainable energy economy is achievable through these three components: solar and wind energy, stationary battery storage, and electric vehicles. The limiting factor for progress will be battery cell production, as the entire lithium-ion battery supply chain, from mining to refining and manufacturing, will determine the pace of achieving sustainability.
Chris Anderson:We need to discuss batteries further because I want to understand the scaling issue, which is both impressive and concerning. You mentioned that the world requires 300 terawatt hours of battery production for sustainability.
Elon Musk:That is.

Chris Anderson:And obtained.
Elon Musk:These are very rough numbers. I would certainly invite others to verify our calculations, as they might reach different conclusions. However, to transition not only current electricity production but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the required electricity, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt hours of installed capacity.
Chris Anderson:We need to give people a sense of how big a task that is. Here we are at the giga factory, one of the largest buildings in the world. From what I've read, the goal is to eventually produce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here annually.
Elon Musk:We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully, we will achieve that within a couple of years.
Chris Anderson:That is.
Elon Musk:1 terawatt hour.
Chris Anderson:That is still one hundredth of what is needed. How much of the rest is Tesla planning to take on between now and 2040, when we really need to see the scale-up happen?
Elon Musk:These are just guesses, so people shouldn't hold me to these predictions. It's not like this is what will definitely happen. I'll make some best guesses, and in five years, someone might write an article saying Elon said this would happen and it didn't, calling him a liar and a fool, which is very annoying. These are just guesses, and this is a conversation. I think Tesla will probably achieve about 10% of that, roughly.
Chris Anderson:By 2050, we could have a fully sustainable electric grid composed of a mix of renewable energy sources. This grid would likely provide the world with significantly lower-cost energy compared to today. I wonder if people are justified in feeling excited about the possibilities of such a future.
Elon Musk:People should remain optimistic about the future. Humanity will solve sustainable energy if we continue to push hard. The future is bright, especially from an energy perspective. With sustainable energy, it will be possible to use that energy for carbon sequestration. Removing carbon from the atmosphere requires significant energy, as releasing it into the atmosphere releases energy. If we have abundant sustainable energy from wind and solar sources, we can sequester carbon, reducing the CO2 levels in the atmosphere and oceans. Additionally, we can have as much fresh water as needed. Earth is mostly water, with 70% of its surface covered by water, mostly seawater. However, we primarily inhabit the land portion.
