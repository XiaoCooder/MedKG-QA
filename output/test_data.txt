Chris Anderson:Elon Musk, it's great to see you. How are you?
Elon Musk:Good. How are you?
Chris Anderson:We are here at the Texas Giga Factory the day before it opens. It has been quite chaotic outside. Thank you for making time on such a busy day. I would like you to help us envision the future, perhaps 10, 20, or even 30 years ahead, and imagine what it would take to build a future worth being excited about. You have often mentioned that during your last speech at 10:00, you said that was a major motivator. While you discuss many other reasons for your actions, fundamentally, you want to think about the future and not feel that it is bleak.
Elon Musk:Absolutely. I think there is a lot of discussion about various problems, and many people feel sad and pessimistic about the future. This is not ideal. We should wake up in the morning and look forward to the future with excitement.
Chris Anderson:It happens.
Elon Musk:Life cannot simply be about solving one miserable problem after another.
Chris Anderson:If you look ahead 30 years to 2050, scientists have labeled it as a critical deadline for climate action. A large consensus of scientists believes that if greenhouse gases are not completely eliminated or offset by 2050, we risk a climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway to avoid this catastrophe, and what would it look like?
Elon Musk:I am not one of the doomsday predictors. I actually believe we are on a good path. However, I want to caution against complacency. As long as we maintain a high sense of urgency in transitioning to a sustainable energy economy, things will be fine. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of pushing hard and avoiding complacency. The future will be great. Do not worry excessively, as worrying ironically becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. There are three key elements to a sustainable energy future: sustainable energy generation, primarily wind and solar, along with hydro and geothermal. I support nuclear energy as well, though solar and wind will be the main energy sources. The second element is the need for batteries to store solar and wind energy, as the sun does not always shine, and the wind does not always blow. This requires stationary battery packs. The third element is electric transport, including electric cars, planes, and boats. While electric rockets are not feasible, sustainable propellants can be used. Ultimately, a fully sustainable energy economy is achievable through these three components: solar and wind energy, stationary battery storage, and electric vehicles. The limiting factor for progress will be battery cell production, which will determine the pace of advancement. The slowest element in the lithium-ion battery supply chain, from mining and refining to creating battery cells and assembling packs, will be the primary constraint on achieving sustainability.
Chris Anderson:We need to discuss batteries further because I want to understand the scaling issue, which is both impressive and concerning. You mentioned that the world requires 300 terawatt hours of battery production for sustainability.
Elon Musk:That is.
Chris Anderson:And obtained.
Elon Musk:These are very rough numbers. I would certainly invite others to verify our calculations, as they might reach different conclusions. However, to transition not only current electricity production but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the required electricity, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt hours of installed capacity.
Chris Anderson:We need to give people a sense of how big a task that is. Here we are at the giga factory, one of the largest buildings in the world. From what I've read, the goal is to eventually produce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here annually.
Elon Musk:We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully, we will achieve that within a couple of years.
Chris Anderson:That is.
Elon Musk:1 terawatt hour, but.
Chris Anderson:That is still one hundredth of what is needed. How much of the remaining portion is Tesla planning to handle between now and 2030 or 2040, when the scale-up needs to occur?
Elon Musk:These are just guesses, so people shouldn't hold me to these things. It's not like this is what will definitely happen. I'll make some best guesses, and in five years, someone might write an article saying Elon predicted this and it didn't happen, calling him a liar and a fool. That's very annoying. These are just guesses; this is a conversation. I think Tesla might end up achieving about 10% of that, roughly.
Chris Anderson:By 2050, we could have a fully sustainable electric grid composed of a mix of renewable energy sources. This grid would likely provide the world with significantly lower-cost energy compared to today. I am curious if people are justified in feeling excited about the possibilities of such a future.
Elon Musk:People should remain optimistic about the future. Humanity will solve sustainable energy challenges if we continue to push hard. The future is bright, especially from an energy perspective. With sustainable energy, it will be possible to use that energy for carbon sequestration. Removing carbon from the atmosphere requires significant energy, as releasing it into the atmosphere releases energy. If we have abundant sustainable energy from wind and solar sources, we can sequester carbon and reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere and oceans. Additionally, we can have as much fresh water as needed. Earth is mostly water, with 70% of its surface covered by water, primarily seawater. However, we inhabit the land portion.
Chris Anderson:With energy, you can turn seawater into irrigation water.
Elon Musk:Or absolutely at very low cost. Things will be good.
Chris Anderson:Things will be good. There are also other benefits to this non-fossil fuel world, such as cleaner air.
Elon Musk:Exactly, when fossil fuels are burned, numerous side reactions and toxic gases are produced. These include harmful particulates that damage the lungs and other negative effects. These issues will disappear, resulting in cleaner air and a quieter environment.
Chris Anderson:I want us to shift our focus to artificial intelligence. As a segue, you mentioned how annoying it is when people criticize you for past inaccurate predictions. I might be annoying now, but I am curious about your timelines and prediction methods, and why some predictions are remarkably accurate while others are not. For example, when predicting Tesla vehicle sales, you have been impressive. In 2014, when Tesla sold 60,000 cars that year, you predicted that by 2020, Tesla would produce half a million cars annually.
Elon Musk:The number was almost exactly half a million.
Chris Anderson:You almost did exactly that. You were mocked in 2014.
Elon Musk:Because.
Chris Anderson:No one since Henry Ford with the Model T has come close to that kind of growth rate.
Elon Musk:For cars.
Chris Anderson:You were mocked, but you actually produced 500,000 cars, or 510,000, or whatever. However, five years ago, the last time you came to TED, I asked you about self-driving cars, and you said that this very year you were confident that we would have a car driving from LA to New York without any intervention.
Elon Musk:I don't want to surprise you, but I'm not always right.
Chris Anderson:What is the difference between those two? Why has full self-driving, in particular, been so difficult to predict?
Elon Musk:The thing that really got me, and I think it will get a lot of other people, is that there are so many false dawns with self-driving technology. You think you have a handle on the problem, but then you realize you've hit a ceiling. If you were to plot the progress, it would look like a series of logarithmic curves. Most people don't understand this, but it is the reality.
Chris Anderson:Shows.
Elon Musk:The trend initially rises in a fairly straight line and then begins to taper off, leading to diminishing returns. It appears to be trending upward initially but then curves over, reaching what I refer to as local maxima. At these points, the limitations become apparent only in hindsight. To achieve full self-driving capabilities, solving real-world AI is essential. Road networks are designed to function with biological neural networks, such as human brains, and vision systems, such as human eyes. Therefore, to adapt this system for computers, real-world AI and advanced vision systems must be developed. Cameras and silicon-based neural networks are required to enable self-driving in a system originally designed for biological vision and neural processing. When framed this way, it becomes evident that solving real-world AI and sophisticated vision is the only way to achieve self-driving technology.
Chris Anderson:What is your opinion on the current architecture? Do you think the current architecture allows for the possibility of a logarithmic curve, without any imminent decline?
Elon Musk:I am confident that we will solve it this year and exceed expectations. What is the probability of an accident, and at what points do you exceed that of the average person? I believe we will exceed that this year.
Chris Anderson:What are you seeing behind the scenes that gives you that confidence?
Elon Musk:We are almost at the point of achieving a high-quality unified vector space. Initially, we attempted to do this with image recognition on individual eye images. However, looking at a single image from a video makes it difficult to understand what is happening without ambiguity. Viewing a video segment of a few seconds resolves this ambiguity. The first step is to synchronize all eight cameras so that their frames are examined and labeled simultaneously by one person, as human labeling is still necessary. This ensures consistency in labeling, avoiding discrepancies caused by different people labeling at different times. The process involves creating a surround picture. Adding the time dimension is crucial, allowing the examination and labeling of surround video, which is challenging from a software perspective. We developed our own labeling tools and created order labeling software to enhance the efficiency of human labor. Initially, labeling a 10-second video clip took several hours, which is not scalable. The solution involves primarily automatic labeling of surround video, with humans acting as editors making minor corrections. These corrections are then fed back to improve future labeling. The goal is to enable the order laborer to process vast amounts of video with high accuracy, automatically labeling elements such as cars, lane lines, and drive space.
Chris Anderson:The result of this is that you are effectively giving the car a 3D model of the actual objects around it. It knows what they are and how fast they are moving. The remaining task is to predict unpredictable behaviors, such as when a pedestrian walking down the road with a smaller pedestrian might act unpredictably. These factors must be accounted for before the system can be considered safe.
Elon Musk:You need memory across time and space. Memory cannot be infinite because it consumes significant computer resources. You must decide how much to remember. It is common for certain elements to be included. For example, if you see a pedestrian walking past a truck, starting on one side and then being obscured by the truck, you intuitively know the pedestrian will likely reappear on the other side.
Chris Anderson:The computer doesn't know, so you need to provide the information.
Elon Musk:I need to slow down.
Chris Anderson:A skeptic might argue that for the past five years, you have consistently claimed that this is the year. You have expressed confidence that the technology will be ready within a year or two, always suggesting it is just around the corner. However, with the new architecture, you are now observing significant improvements behind the scenes. While not certain, you are fairly confident that by the end of this year, in most cities and circumstances, though not all, the car will be able to drive without interventions and safer than a human.
Elon Musk:Yes, the car currently drives me around Austin most of the time without any interventions. We have over 100,000 people in our Full Self-Driving Beta program. You can watch the videos they post online.
Chris Anderson:Okay.
Elon Musk:Great. And some of.
Chris Anderson:Some of them are great, and some are a little terrifying. Occasionally, the car seems to veer off and scare people. However, it is still improving. You are behind the scenes, analyzing the data, and seeing enough progress to believe in the timeline for this year.
Elon Musk:That seems realistic. We could be here talking again in a year, and it might not have happened, but I believe this is the year.
Chris Anderson:In general, when people talk about Elon time, it seems that you cannot simply apply a general rule that if something is predicted to be done in six months, it will actually take a year or two or three times longer, depending on the type of prediction. Some things, such as software or AI, are fundamentally harder to predict than others. Is there an element where you deliberately set aggressive timelines to drive people to be ambitious, and without that, nothing gets done?
Elon Musk:I generally believe in setting the most aggressive internal timelines possible, as there is a tendency for schedules to expand rather than contract. It is rare for timelines to be shorter than planned. Regarding my predictions, the media often reports the incorrect ones and ignores the accurate ones. For instance, when writing about my career across multiple industries, listing only my mistakes makes me appear as the worst person, but balancing them with my achievements provides a more accurate perspective. The longer one engages in any activity, the more mistakes accumulate, which, when summed up, can create a misleading impression. For example, I predicted 50% growth for Tesla vehicles, but we achieved 80%. However, such successes are often overlooked. My predictions tend to be optimistic rather than pessimistic, and while some are exceeded, most come true eventually. The key point is not whether a radical technology prediction is slightly delayed, but that it happens at all, which is the more significant aspect.
Chris Anderson:It seems that at some point in the last year, the progress in understanding AI, particularly Tesla's AI understanding the world around it, led to a significant realization. This is because you recently surprised people by stating that the most important product development at Tesla this year is the robot Optimus. Many companies have attempted to develop such robots for years, but so far, no one has truly succeeded. There is no mass adoption of robots in people's homes, and while some are used in manufacturing, no one has fully achieved it. What development in full self-driving gave you the confidence to believe that Tesla could achieve something special?
Elon Musk:It took me some time to realize that solving self-driving technology requires solving real-world AI. Once you solve real-world AI for a car, which is essentially a robot on four wheels, you can generalize it to a robot on legs. The two main challenges are not the hardware, as companies like Boston Dynamics have demonstrated the ability to create compelling and sometimes alarming robots from a sensor and actuator perspective. The missing components are sufficient intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world and perform useful tasks without explicit instructions. The key missing elements are real-world intelligence and scaling up manufacturing. Tesla excels in these areas. We need to design specialized actuators and sensors for a human-like robot. People do not realize this will be more significant than the car industry.
Chris Anderson:Let's examine that. In one way, it's actually an easier problem than full self-driving because, instead of an object moving at 60 miles per hour, where a mistake could result in a fatality, this is an object designed to move at only 3, 4, or 5 miles per hour.
Elon Musk:Walking speed.
Chris Anderson:A mistake is assuming that lives are not at stake. There might be embarrassment at stake, always.
Elon Musk:The AI does not take it over.
Chris Anderson:Right.
Elon Musk:It is now time to sleep or something.
Chris Anderson:The first applications you mentioned are likely to be in manufacturing, but the vision is to eventually make these available for home use. If you had a robot that understood the 3D architecture of your house, knew the location of every object, and could recognize all those objects, that would be remarkable. The tasks you could ask such a robot to perform would include tidying up.
Elon Musk:Absolutely.
Chris Anderson:Or.
Elon Musk:Make dinner. Mow the lawn.
Chris Anderson:Take a cup of tea to grandma and show her family pictures.
Elon Musk:To take care of my grandmother and ensure her well-being.
Chris Anderson:When he could recognize everyone in the home, he could play catch with your kids.
Elon Musk:We need to ensure this does not become a dystopian situation. One important measure is to have a localized chip on the robot that cannot be updated remotely. For example, if someone says "stop," the robot would stop, and this feature should not be updatable over the air. Such safety features are crucial.
Chris Anderson:That sounds reasonable.
Elon Musk:I believe there should be a regulatory agency for AI. I have advocated for this for many years. While I do not enjoy being regulated, I consider it essential for public safety.
Chris Anderson:Let's return to that topic, but I don't think many people have taken the idea of a robot at home seriously. At the beginning of the computing revolution, Bill Gates predicted that there would be a computer in every home, and people at the time dismissed it, questioning who would even want that.
Elon Musk:He created a computer that fits in our pocket.
Chris Anderson:Do you think that by 2050, most homes will have a robot, and people will interact with them?
Elon Musk:I think they probably want to count on them.
Chris Anderson:You have your own butler.
Elon Musk:You will have your companion robot.
Chris Anderson:How much of a buddy do you like to be? How many applications have you considered? Can you have a romantic partner or sex?
Elon Musk:Partner? That is probably inevitable. I promised the internet that I would figure out how to make a robot cackle.
Chris Anderson:I.
Elon Musk:I.
Chris Anderson:I was interested in that.
Elon Musk:It will be whatever people want.
Chris Anderson:What timeline should we consider for the first models that are actually produced and sold?
Elon Musk:The initial units we produce are designed for dangerous, boring, and repetitive tasks that people prefer not to do. We expect to develop an interesting prototype this year, potentially have something useful by next year, and likely achieve significant progress within at least two years. Following that, we anticipate rapid annual growth in the usefulness of humanoid robots, alongside decreasing costs and increased production scaling.
Chris Anderson:Initially, we only sold to businesses. When do you envision starting to sell them to individuals, so you can buy one for your parents for Christmas?
Elon Musk:It will take less than 10 years.
Chris Anderson:How can you help me with the economics of this? What do you estimate the cost of one of these to be?
Elon Musk:I think the cost will not be excessively high, likely less than that of a car. Initially, the price will be high due to new technology and low production volume. The complexity and cost of a car are greater than those of a humanoid robot. I expect the cost to be less than a car or at least equivalent to an inexpensive one.
Chris Anderson:Even if a car starts at $50,000, within a few years, its price drops to $20,000 or lower. Home robots might become even cheaper. Consider the economics: replacing a $30,000 to $40,000 annual worker with a one-time $25,000 robot that can work longer hours could lead to a rapid replacement of certain jobs. How concerned should the world be about this?
Elon Musk:I wouldn't worry about putting people out of jobs. I think we are already experiencing and will continue to have a significant labor shortage. Therefore, I believe we will not have people out of work but will still face a labor shortage in the future. However, this will be a world of abundance where any goods and services will be available to anyone who wants them, and the cost of goods and services will be extremely low.
Chris Anderson:It should be possible to imagine a variety of goods and services that are not profitable now but could be produced in that world due to religions.
Elon Musk:Robots will create a world of abundance. The only scarcity in the future will be what we, as humans, choose to create.
Chris Anderson:AI is enabling us to envision a differently powered economy that will create abundance. What concerns you most about potential failures?
Elon Musk:AI and robotics will usher in what might be called the age of abundance. Others have used this term, and I predict it will be an era of abundance for everyone. The potential dangers include artificial general intelligence or digital superintelligence becoming detached from collective human will and moving in a direction we might not prefer. The idea behind Neuralink is to more closely align collective human will with digital superintelligence. Additionally, it aims to address brain and spinal injuries. Even if it does not achieve its broader goal, I believe it will succeed in alleviating brain and spinal damage.
Chris Anderson:The idea is that if we create highly intelligent AI, we should align them directly with our goals so that we can benefit from those superpowers more directly. However, this approach does not eliminate the risk that those superpowers might lead to unintended negative consequences.
Elon Musk:No, I think it's a risk. I agree. I'm not claiming to have a definitive solution to that risk. I'm suggesting that one way to ensure a desirable future might be to more closely integrate the collective human world with digital intelligence. The issue we face is that we are already a digital extension. Computers act as extensions of ourselves. When we die, a digital ghost remains, including text messages, social media, and emails. It feels eerie when someone passes away, yet their online presence persists. The limitation inhibiting human-machine symbiosis is the data rate. When communicating, especially via phone, you use your thumbs at a slow rate, perhaps 10 bits per second, or optimistically 100 bits per second. In contrast, computers communicate at gigabit speeds and beyond.
Chris Anderson:Have you seen evidence that the technology is working, providing a richer, higher-bandwidth connection between external electronics and a brain, which was not possible before?
Elon Musk:The fundamental principles of reading neurons have been demonstrated for decades using tiny electrodes. The concept is not new, but the issue is the lack of a well-functioning product available for purchase. Currently, these technologies remain confined to research labs, often involving invasive methods like protruding wires from the head, which are impractical and unappealing. There is no high-bandwidth, safe, and market-ready product that people would want to buy. The vision for a neural device is akin to a Fitbit or Apple Watch. It involves replacing a small section of the skull, about the size of a quarter, with a device resembling a smartwatch. This device would include extremely fine wires, almost invisible to the naked eye, to ensure minimal brain damage during implantation. How far along is this development?
Chris Anderson:What prevents you from putting these into humans?
Elon Musk:We have submitted our FDA application for the aspiration due to the first human implant this year.
Chris Anderson:The initial applications will be for various types of neurological injuries.
Elon Musk:But.
Chris Anderson:Looking ahead and imagining when people use these for personal enhancement and the betterment of the world, how clear is your vision of what it will feel like to have one of these inside your head?
Elon Musk:I do want to emphasize that we are at an early stage. It will take many years before we develop anything resembling a high-bandwidth neural interface that enables AI-human symbiosis. For many years, our focus will primarily be on addressing brain and spinal injuries, likely for at least a decade. This is not something that will suddenly result in a comprehensive whole-brain interface. As I mentioned, it will take at least a decade to make significant progress in treating brain and spinal injuries. I believe we can address a wide range of brain-related issues, including severe depression, obesity, sleep disorders, and potentially even conditions like schizophrenia. These are problems that cause significant stress to individuals, and we aim to restore memory and functionality in affected people.
Chris Anderson:If you can achieve that, I will sign up for the app.
Elon Musk:I.
Chris Anderson:I would like you to hurry.
Elon Musk:The emails we receive at Neuralink are heartbreaking. They often describe tragic situations, such as someone in the prime of life who had a motorcycle accident. A 25-year-old who can't even feed themselves is something we could fix.
Chris Anderson:You have stated that AI is one of your biggest concerns, and that Neuralink may be one of the ways to keep up with it.
Elon Musk:There is a short-term benefit, which I believe is helpful on an individual human level for injuries. The long-term goal is to address the civilization risk of AI by bringing digital intelligence and biological intelligence closer together. If you consider how the brain functions today, it consists of two layers: the limbic system and the cortex. The limbic system represents the animal brain, which is the more instinctive part.
Chris Anderson:Most of Twitter operates in this way.
Elon Musk:Tim Evans once said that we are like a monkey with a computer attached to it. Our cortex is like a computer given to a monkey, but we still retain many monkey instincts. We often try to rationalize these instincts as something more significant, but they are often just primal behaviors. Essentially, we are monkeys with a computer-like cortex in our brains. Although the cortex is the intelligent, thinking part of the brain, no one wants to remove the limbic system or the cortex. People want both parts of their brain. Additionally, people desire their phones and computers, which act as a third layer of intelligence. However, the communication bandwidth with this tertiary layer is slow, like a tiny straw. The goal is to turn that tiny straw into a large highway. This is not a solution to everything, but it could be helpful. At the very least, it might address important brain and spinal injury issues, which would still be a significant achievement.
Chris Anderson:In the best-case scenario, we may discover new human possibilities, such as telepathy. You have mentioned a way of connecting with a loved one, full memory, and a much faster thought process. These ideas are very intriguing. If AI were to threaten Earth, we would need a backup plan, so let's focus on space. Last summer, we discussed reusability, and you had just demonstrated it spectacularly for the first time. Since then, you have developed the massive Starship rocket, which significantly changes the rules of the game in remarkable ways. Tell us about Starship.
Elon Musk:The holy grail of rocketry or space transport is full and rapid reusability, which has never been achieved. The closest example is the Falcon 9 rocket, where the first stage, the booster, which constitutes about 60-70% of the vehicle's cost, has been recovered over 100 times. With Starship, the goal is to recover the entire vehicle and enable immediate re-flight by simply refilling propellants. This represents a significant advancement, as Falcon 9 still requires some refurbishment of the booster and fairing nose cone. Achieving immediate reusability would be transformative, similar to advancements in other modes of transportation.
Chris Anderson:The main design is to transport over 100 people at a time, along with the necessary equipment, to Mars. First, discuss the latest timeline. When will a Starship go to Mars for the first time, presumably without people but with equipment? Second, when will it carry people? Third, when will it transport around 100 people at a time?
Elon Musk:The expected cost of Starship putting 100 tons into orbit is significantly less than the cost of launching the Falcon 1 rocket. Similarly, the cost of flying a 747 around the world is less than the cost of operating a small, disposable airplane. It is remarkable that the larger system costs far less than the smaller one. Starship does not use exotic propellants or materials difficult to obtain on Mars. It uses methane as fuel, which is primarily oxygen, roughly 77-78% by weight. Mars has a CO2 atmosphere and water ice, which can be converted into methane (CH4) and oxygen (O2).
Chris Anderson:One of the first tasks on Mars will be to create.
